- My powershell config. It uses oh-my-posh to customize
- Cascadia Code Nerd Font is used
- Terminal-Icons is used to get the icons there
- A nerd Font is nessecarry to get the icons.
- Also used z for cd completion, PSReadline for autocompletion
- I made my own theme inspired by other oh-my-posh themes. It is a minimal yet powerful one. It should git branch and Node version.
