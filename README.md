- My powershell config. It uses [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) to customize
- [Terminal-Icons](https://github.com/devblackops/Terminal-Icons) is used to get the icons there
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) is nessecarry to get the icons. I use Cascadia Codes Patched Version (included in repo)
- Also used z for cd completion, [PSReadline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/psreadline/) for autocompletion
- I made my own theme inspired by other oh-my-posh themes. It is a minimal yet powerful one. It should git branch and Node version.
